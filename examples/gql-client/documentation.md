# How to Connect Strobes GraphQL Client to Strobes Platform

## What You Need to Know

This guide will help you connect the Strobes GraphQL Client to your Strobes platform. Think of this like setting up a secure connection between two systems so they can talk to each other.

## üìã Prerequisites - What You Need Before Starting

**Before you can use the Strobes GraphQL Client, you need to have these things installed on your computer:**

### 1. Python Installation
**You need Python installed on your computer.**

**To check if Python is installed:**
1. **Open Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux)
2. **Type this command and press Enter:**
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
3. **If you see a version number** (like "Python 3.9.0"), you're good to go!
4. **If you get an error**, you need to install Python

**To install Python:**
- **Windows:** Go to [python.org](https://python.org) and download the latest version
- **Mac:** Python usually comes pre-installed, or use Homebrew: `brew install python3`
- **Linux:** Use your package manager: `sudo apt install python3` (Ubuntu/Debian)

### 2. Install Required Packages
**After Python is installed, you need to install the required software packages.**

1. **Open Command Prompt or Terminal**
2. **Navigate to the Strobes GraphQL Client folder** (where you see the `requirements.txt` file)
3. **Install the requirements by typing:**
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Wait for the installation to complete** (this might take a few minutes)

**What this does:** This installs all the necessary software that the Strobes GraphQL Client needs to work properly.

### 3. Virtual Environment (Recommended)
**It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep things organized.**

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On Mac/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install requirements in the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**You'll know it's working when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command line.**

**Once you have Python installed and the requirements set up, you can continue with the steps below!**

## Step 1: Get Your Connection Information

Before you can connect, you need to collect some information from your Strobes platform. Think of this like getting the address and key to a building:

**You'll need these 5 pieces of information:**
- **Host**: This is like the address of your Strobes platform (e.g., "strobes.company.com" or "192.168.1.100")
- **API Token**: This is like a special password that lets the client access your platform
- **Scheme**: This tells the system whether to use "http" or "https" (https is more secure)
- **Port**: This is like a specific door number (usually 80 for http, 443 for https)
- **Organization ID**: This is your company's unique identifier in the system

## Step 2: Get Your API Token and Organization ID

**This is like getting your special access card and company ID number.**

Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Open your web browser** and go to your Strobes platform website
2. **Log in** with your username and password
3. **Look for the Settings menu** (usually in the top-right corner or main menu)
4. **Click on "Settings"** and then look for **"API Access"**
5. **Click "Generate Token"** - this creates your special access password
6. **Copy the token** that appears (it will look like a long string of letters and numbers)
7. **Write down your Organization ID** - this should also be visible on the same page

**Important:** Keep this token safe! It's like your password to the system.

## Step 3: Set Up the Configuration File

**This is like filling out a form with your connection details.**

1. **Open File Explorer** (Windows) or **Finder** (Mac) and navigate to the Strobes GraphQL Client folder
2. **Go to this folder:** `examples/gql-client/`
3. **Find the file called `config.py`** and open it with any text editor (like Notepad, TextEdit, or VS Code)
4. **Replace the information** in the file with your details:

   Look for these lines and change them:
   ```python
   HOST = "your-strobes-host.com"        # Change this to your actual host
   API_TOKEN = "your-api-token-here"     # Change this to your actual token
   SCHEME = "https"                      # Usually "https" (more secure) or "http"
   PORT = 443                            # Usually 443 for https, 80 for http
   ORGANIZATION_ID = "your-org-id-here"  # Change this to your actual organization ID
   ```

**Example of what it should look like:**
```python
HOST = "strobes.mycompany.com"
API_TOKEN = "abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz"
SCHEME = "https"
PORT = 443
ORGANIZATION_ID = "3c5d440c-2b62-4446-bf99-24c492d6a0f5"
```

**Save the file** after making these changes!

## Step 4: Test Your Connection

**This is like testing if your key works before trying to open the door.**

1. **Open Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux)
2. **Navigate to the folder:** `examples/gql-client/`
3. **Type this command and press Enter:**
   ```bash
   python3 test_connectivity.py
   ```

**What you should see:**
- If it works: You'll see a success message saying the connection is working
- If it doesn't work: You'll see an error message - this means you need to check your configuration

**If you get an error, check:**
- Did you save the config.py file?
- Are all the details correct (host, token, organization ID)?
- Is your Strobes platform running and accessible?

## Step 5: What You Can Do Now

**Great! Once your connection is working, you can use these tools:**

### üìÅ Asset Management (Creating and Managing Assets)
- **Create Web Assets**: Make new web applications, websites, or APIs in the system
- **Create Network Assets**: Add servers, computers, or network devices
- **Create Code Assets**: Add software code or applications
